# 🗳️ Blockchain Voting System - Demo Setup

## Quick Demo Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Ganache** - Download and install from https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
2. **MetaMask** - Install browser extension
3. **Node.js** (v16+) - Already installed ✅

### Step 1: Start Ganache
1. Open Ganache
2. Create a new workspace or quickstart
3. Ensure it's running on `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`
4. Note down the first account address and private key

### Step 2: Configure MetaMask
1. Open MetaMask
2. Add custom network:
   - Network Name: `Ganache`
   - RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7545`
   - Chain ID: `1337` (or `5777`)
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
3. Import the first Ganache account using its private key

### Step 3: Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
cd blockchain
npx truffle migrate --network development
```

### Step 4: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend  
npm start
```

### Step 5: Demo the Voting System

#### As Admin (First Account):
1. Connect MetaMask to the dapp
2. Add candidates (e.g., "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
3. Open voting

#### As Voter (Switch to different accounts):
1. Import more Ganache accounts to MetaMask
2. Switch to different account
3. Register to vote
4. Cast vote
5. View results

## Demo Flow

### 1. Admin Setup
- ✅ Connect MetaMask with first Ganache account (you're automatically admin)
- ✅ Add candidates using the admin panel
- ✅ Open voting when ready

### 2. Voter Experience
- 🔄 Switch MetaMask to a different Ganache account
- 📝 Register as voter (self-registration for demo)
- 🗳️ Cast vote for preferred candidate
- 📊 View real-time results

### 3. Key Features to Demonstrate
- **Blockchain Transparency**: All votes recorded on-chain
- **Immutability**: Votes cannot be changed once cast
- **Real-time Results**: Vote counts update immediately
- **Access Control**: Only registered voters can vote
- **One Vote Per Person**: Prevented by smart contract
- **MetaMask Integration**: Secure wallet-based authentication

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
1. **"Failed to connect"** - Make sure Ganache is running on port 7545
2. **"Transaction failed"** - Check MetaMask is connected to Ganache network
3. **"Contract not found"** - Ensure you ran `truffle migrate` first
4. **"Not registered"** - Click "Register to Vote" button first

**Network Issues:**
- Ganache URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7545`
- Chain ID should be `1337` or `5777`
- Make sure MetaMask is connected to the right network

### Demo Script
